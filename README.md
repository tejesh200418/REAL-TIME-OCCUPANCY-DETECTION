# Real-Time Occupancy Detection System

This project simulates a real-time human occupancy detection system using Arduino, PIR sensor, and LCD display. It turns ON an LED and displays status based on detected motion.

## Features
- Detects human motion using PIR sensor
- Turns ON an LED upon detection
- Displays "Occupied" or "Vacant" on LCD
- Real-time response simulation
